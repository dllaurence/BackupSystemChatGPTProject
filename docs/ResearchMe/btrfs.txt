Remember the other tools for the partitions where btrfs volumes live:

df
fdisk -l

btrfs commands

For example's sake, I'll use the Linux partion on my F40 disk,
/dev/nvme0n1p3 mounted on /

List basic informaton about a (possibly unmounted btrfs filesystem

sudo btrfs filesystem show /dev/nvme0n1p3

List subvolumes of a mounted filesystem

sudo btrfs subvolume list /
